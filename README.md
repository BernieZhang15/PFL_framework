> *Personalizing Low-rank Bayesian Neural Networks via Federated Learning*  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project contains the implementation of our proposed framework for **personalized federated learning** with **low-rank Bayesian neural networks (BNNs)**.  
It is designed to enable efficient model personalization under federated settings while maintaining scalability and robustness.
